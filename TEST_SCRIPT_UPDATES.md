# Test Script Updates

## Changes Made to test_attitude_control.py

### Added `is_armed()` Function
Checks the vehicle's armed state by reading the HEARTBEAT message:
- Returns `True` if vehicle is armed
- Returns `False` if vehicle is disarmed
- Uses MAV_MODE_FLAG_SAFETY_ARMED bit from base_mode

### Updated `arm()` Function
Now checks armed state before attempting to arm:
- ✅ Skips arming if already armed
- ✅ Verifies arm status after sending command
- ✅ Shows warning if arming fails

### Updated `disarm()` Function
Now checks armed state before attempting to disarm:
- ✅ Skips disarming if already disarmed
- ✅ Verifies disarm status after sending command
- ✅ Shows warning if disarming fails

### Added Initial State Check
Script now shows vehicle state at startup:
- Displays initial armed/disarmed state
- Helps user understand current vehicle status

## Usage

```bash
cd /Users/gauravsinghbhati/Documents/PX4_minimal
python3 test_attitude_control.py
```

## Example Output

```
Connecting to PX4...
✓ Connected! System ID: 1, Component ID: 1

============================================================
PX4 ATTITUDE CONTROL TEST
============================================================

Checking initial vehicle state...
Initial state: ARMED ⚠

[1/4] Vehicle is already ARMED ✓

[2/4] Setting STABILIZED mode...
✓ Mode command sent

[3/4] Testing attitude control...
...
```

## Benefits

1. **Safe Re-runs**: Won't try to arm an already armed vehicle
2. **Status Visibility**: Always shows current armed state
3. **Verification**: Confirms arm/disarm commands succeeded
4. **Prevents Errors**: Avoids "already armed" errors from PX4
